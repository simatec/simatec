### Hello,

most of my time, besides family and job, is spent on making IoT easier to use for everyone - with Node.js and JavaScript.

I am one of the developers of the smart home automation software [ioBroker](https://www.iobroker.net). 
In addition to developing my own adapters for ioBroker, I continue to assist in the development of ioBroker. 

Furthermore, I provide support on Github, in the [ioBroker forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/) and on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HwUCwsH). 

My goal with all this work is to provide the best possible quality for users and community members and to make life easier and more convenient for all ioBroker users.

If you want to support me, you can:
