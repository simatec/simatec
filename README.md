### Hello,

most of my time, besides family and job, is spent on making IoT easier to use for everyone - with Node.js and JavaScript.

I am one of the developers of the smart home automation software [ioBroker](https://www.iobroker.net). In addition to developing my own adapters for ioBroker, I continue to assist in the development of ioBroker. Furthermore, I provide support on Github, in the [ioBroker forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/) and on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HwUCwsH). My goal with all this work is to provide the best possible quality for users and community members and to make life easier and more convenient for all ioBroker users.
